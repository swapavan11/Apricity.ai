## 📦 Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **User Model** (`server/src/models/User.js`)

Added `generalAttempts` array to store non-PDF quiz attempts:

```javascript
generalAttempts: [{
  quizType: String,
  score: Number,
  total: Number,
  questionResults: [{ /* Full question data */ }],
  overallAccuracy: Number,
  mcqAccuracy: Number,
  saqAccuracy: Number,
  laqAccuracy: Number,
  onewordAccuracy: Number,
  topics: [{
    name: String,
    accuracy: Number,
    questionsCount: Number
  }],
  strengths: [String],
  weaknesses: [String],
  suggestedTopics: [String],
  timeTaken: Number,
  timeLimit: Number,
  wasTimedOut: Boolean,
  quizParams: {
    mode: String,
    mcqCount: Number,
    onewordCount: Number,
    saqCount: Number,
    laqCount: Number,
    topics: [String],
    instructions: String
  },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
}]
```

**Same structure as PDF attempts**, but stored on User instead of Document.

#### 2. **Quiz Scoring Route** (`server/src/routes/quiz.js`)

```javascript
if (documentId) {
  // Save to document's attempts array (PDF quiz)
  await Document.findByIdAndUpdate(documentId, { 
    $push: { attempts: attemptData } 
  });
} else {
  // Save to user's general attempts (non-PDF quiz)
  const User = (await import('../models/User.js')).default;
  await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.user._id, { 
    $push: { generalAttempts: attemptData } 
  });
}
```

**Result**: All quizzes are now saved, whether PDF-based or general!

#### 3. **Progress Route** (`server/src/routes/progress.js`)

New endpoint to fetch general attempts:

```javascript
// GET /api/progress/attempts/general/all
router.get('/attempts/general/all', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findById(req.user._id).select('generalAttempts');
  
  const sortedAttempts = user.generalAttempts
    .map((attempt, index) => ({
      ...attempt.toObject(),
      attemptNumber: user.generalAttempts.length - index,
      id: `general_${index}`
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.createdAt) - new Date(a.createdAt));

  res.json({
    title: 'General Quizzes',
    attempts: sortedAttempts,
    totalAttempts: user.generalAttempts.length
  });
});
```

---

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **API Hook** (`client/src/api/useApi.js`)

Added method to fetch general attempts:

```javascript
getGeneralAttemptHistory: async () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  const headers = token ? { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } : {};
  return (await fetch(`${base}/api/progress/attempts/general/all`, { headers })).json();
}
```

#### 2. **Study Component** (`client/src/components/Study/Study.jsx`)

Updated `loadAttemptHistory` to handle both PDF and general quizzes:

```javascript
const loadAttemptHistory = async () => {
  setLoadingAttemptHistory(true);
  try {
    let history;
    if (selected === "all") {
      // Load general (non-PDF) quiz attempts
      history = await api.getGeneralAttemptHistory();
    } else {
      // Load PDF-specific attempts
      history = await api.getAttemptHistory(selected);
    }
    setAttemptHistory(history);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Failed to load attempt history:", err);
    setAttemptHistory(null);
  } finally {
    setLoadingAttemptHistory(false);
  }
};
```

**Always loads attempt history**, even when "All PDFs" is selected!

#### 3. **History Section** (`client/src/components/Study/HistorySection.jsx`)

Removed the check that prevented showing history for "all":

```javascript
// BEFORE (Blocked general quizzes)
if (selected === "all") {
  return <div>Select a specific PDF to view attempt history</div>;
}

// AFTER (Allows general quizzes)
// Removed - now shows history for all modes!
```

## 📊 Data Structure

### General Attempt Object:

```javascript
{
  quizType: "mixed",
  score: 8,
  total: 10,
  questionResults: [/* 10 questions */],
  overallAccuracy: 0.8,
  mcqAccuracy: 0.8,
  saqAccuracy: 0.75,
  laqAccuracy: 1.0,
  onewordAccuracy: 0.8,

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Storage Location:

```
PDF Quiz:
┌─────────────┐
│  Document   │
│  {          │
│    _id      │
│    title    │
│    attempts:│ ← Stores here
│    [...]    │
│  }          │
└─────────────┘

General Quiz:
┌─────────────┐
│    User     │
│  {          │
│    _id      │
│    email    │
│    general  │
│    Attempts:│ ← Stores here
│    [...]    │
│  }          │
└─────────────┘
```

### API Endpoints:

```
GET /api/progress/attempts/:documentId
→ Returns PDF-specific attempts

GET /api/progress/attempts/general/all
→ Returns user's general attempts (NEW!)

POST /api/quiz/score
→ Saves to Document.attempts OR User.generalAttempts
   (based on presence of documentId)
```

## 💡 Dashboard Integration (Next Step)

To show general quizzes on dashboard, add this section:

```javascript
{/* General Quiz Statistics */}
{data.generalStats && (
  <div style={{ marginBottom: 24 }}>
    <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.5em', marginBottom: 16 }}>
      📝 General Quizzes
    </h2>
    <div style={{/* ... styling */}}>
      <div>Total Attempts: {data.generalStats.totalAttempts}</div>
      <div>Average Score: {data.generalStats.averageScore}%</div>
      {/* Recent attempts list */}
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

Backend would need to calculate this in `/api/progress`.
