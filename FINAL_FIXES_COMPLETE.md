# 🎉 All Issues Fixed - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ **General Non-PDF Mode Quiz Generation Fixed**

**Problem**: Quiz generation failed when no PDF was selected in custom mode.

**Solution**:
- **Backend** (`server/src/routes/quiz.js`):
  - Modified `/api/quiz/generate` route to handle `null` documentId
  - When documentId is null, use instructions as context directly
  - Skip document validation for general mode
  - Generate quiz based purely on user instructions

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
if (documentId) {
  // Use PDF context
  context = docs.flatMap(d => d.chunks...);
} else {
  // General mode without PDF
  if (!instructions || !instructions.trim()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Instructions required' });
  }
  context = `Generate quiz questions based on the following topic/subject:\n${instructions}`;
}
```

- **Frontend** (`client/src/components/Study/QuizSection.jsx`):
  - Updated placeholder to show helpful text: "Enter topic to generate quiz on (e.g., Python Programming, World War II, Calculus, etc.)"
  - Different placeholder when PDF is selected vs not selected

### 2. ✅ **Quiz Attempt Modal in Dashboard**

**Problem**: No "View Quiz" button in dashboard to see full quiz details.

**Solution**:
- Added **AttemptModal** import to Dashboard
- Added **selectedAttempt** state
- Added **"📝 View Full Quiz" button** to each attempt card
- Added modal at end of component
- Now works in **both** Dashboard and Attempt History!

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/ui/pages/Dashboard.jsx`:
  - Import: `import AttemptModal from '../../components/Study/AttemptModal'`
  - State: `const [selectedAttempt, setSelectedAttempt] = useState(null)`
  - Button in each attempt card
  - Modal at bottom of component

### 3. ✅ **Prevent Duplicate Quiz Submission**

**Problem**: Quiz could be re-submitted multiple times without changing answers.

**Solution**:
- Added **`submittedAnswers`** state to track last submitted answers
- Check if answers changed before allowing resubmission
- Show alert: "Quiz already submitted! Edit your answers to resubmit."
- Reset `submittedAnswers` when generating new quiz
- Save to sessionStorage for persistence

**Logic**:
```javascript
// Before submission
if (submittedAnswers && !wasTimedOut) {
  const answersChanged = JSON.stringify(answers) !== JSON.stringify(submittedAnswers);
  if (!answersChanged) {
    alert('Quiz already submitted! Edit your answers to resubmit.');
    return; // Prevent duplicate submission
  }
}

// After successful submission
setSubmittedAnswers({...answers});
```
