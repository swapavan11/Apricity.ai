## 💡 Why This Approach?

1. **Better UX**: Clear communication that feature is coming
2. **Professional**: Nice modal instead of browser alert
3. **Maintains Button**: Users can still see the button, building anticipation
4. **Detects Active Quiz**: Still shows context-aware button text
5. **Easy to Enable**: When ready, just swap modal content back

---

## 🔄 To Enable Full Retake Later

When you're ready to enable the full retake feature, you'll need to:

1. **Restore the modal content** with timer options
2. **Restore the button handler** to handle continue vs retake
3. **Uncomment the retake logic** in Study.jsx and Dashboard.jsx
4. **Test the auto-generation flow**

All the backend code is already in place - just the frontend is disabled.
